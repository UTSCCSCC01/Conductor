'''
python-electron executor
A tool used to read applet list and execute applications based on name or applet id. 

-
This app lifecycle is managed by electron.
Upon startup the follow enviroment variables are set.

APPDATA = "path_to_save_data/<userid>/
ie: the path will look like this  -> C:/path_to_shared_secret/cognitavit/userid/

inside the userid folder we have the following 

Folder content:
/orchestra_webapps: A folder which consists of shortcuts to the actual binaries. [Located in the download folder] 
/custom_binaries: A folder which consits of shortcut to bots detail. [Located in random place in drive. (which is why its a shortcut)]
/downloads: A place where downloaded items are stored.  
web_app.config: config file of what orchestra web bots are installed.

You may assume that you are already inside the userid/ folder
